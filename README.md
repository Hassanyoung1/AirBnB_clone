# The AirBnB_clone - The Console ‚õ™


## Description üè†
A comprehensive web application comprising database storage, a back-end API, and a front-end interface.
This console serves as our foundational stage in the development of a full-stack web application.
Its primary function is to function as a command interpreter for Airbnb objects,
allowing interactive data model manipulation, object management, and command execution.`

## The Console 
The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend of AirBnB.
It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized by the application (achieved by calls on the ```storage``` object defined above).

## How It Works
The console can be run both interactively and non-interactively.
To run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution of the file ```console.py``` at the command line.

```$ echo "help" | ./console.py
